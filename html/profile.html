        <p>1st question is isit ok to have more than 1 form per page? 
        i read dunno where that 1 page shld have only 1 form, true?
        assuming you do login and register form in 1 page, i think there are 2 approaches
        2 separate forms -> isit ok for form input[name] to be reused? eg. both login
         \and register will have username and passwords field
        1 form. use JS to hide confirmPassword field then at server side check 
        if there is a confirmPassword is filled? upon typing this, this does not seem like a good idea...</p>

        <p>You can have as many forms as you want on a page. There's no restriction,
        just think about whether it makes sense or not.If you're going to have more
        than 1 form,
        it's fine to duplicate field names if they both do the same job. 
        But they may or may not be posting to a different location,  
        so make sure you either do that, or include a hidden field to differentiate which form was completed.
        Don't use JS to hide fields, make the form work without  
        JavaScript if possible then enhance it with JS later.</p>

        <p>Here's a website I used to be the webmaster for, 
        they have an intuitive (from the UI side, anyways) way of getting people to 
        register or login in one page:<br><br>

        <a href = "https://www.usacycling.org/myusac/index.php?pagename=login">
            here</a>

        Note that if you register (on the left) it takes you to another (larger)
        registration form that gathers more specific information. 
        This allows a good quality registration information gathering 
        mechanism while not overwhelming the user.

        It's been a while, but I believe that this example was handled with two separate forms.</p>
